Welcome to my Weather App!

I can't wait to be part of your day! Whether you need to decide on an outfit, cancel plans, or check the humidity, my weather app is here to help! Enjoy it and please reach out to me if you find any bugs or issues. Thank you!

Description

Many weather apps display considerable features and distracting ads. A 7-day forecast, ads, popups, and affiliate links don't help much with a basic weather request.

When you load up the app, enter your location or desired location in the search bar and hit "Enter".

The API will retrieve information and display a result. You will receive the weather in Fahrenheit, a snippet of weather features such as broken clouds, etc, and the humidity.
